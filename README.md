# JS-Back-End-Exam

This project was part of my exam, where I built a full-stack web application using Express.js and MongoDB with Mongoose. The application allows users to register, create, edit, and delete disaster event posts, as well as express interest in events. Authentication is implemented with bcrypt and jsonwebtoken, and sessions are managed to control access. Handlebars was used as the view engine for rendering pages. The provided HTML, CSS, and images were used as a base, and I implemented all back-end logic, database models, and routing.
